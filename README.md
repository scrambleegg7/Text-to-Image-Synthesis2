# Text-to-Image-Synthesis
PyTorch Implementation of the paper - 'Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis' from ICML 2016 [ https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396 ]
Please refer the report.pdf for overview of the process and details regarding the implementation. 

The original paper implemented 4 methods
- GAN
- GAN-CLS [Matching-aware discriminator]
- GAN-INT [Learning with manifold interpolation]
- GAN-INT-CLS [Combination of above two methods]

However, this code only contains the Pytorch implementation of GAN-CLS.
Please refer the original paper [ https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396 ] for the details of other methods.
